###Briefly About Myself
My aim is to become a real professional in programming. I study hard constantly, every single day.  Speaking about my strong sides, I can mention purposefulness and discipline. If we speak about my weak sides I can say that sometimes I can be lazy.

###Skills
Every day I learn new skills as a frontend beginner. This process makes me enthusiastic and hard-working. Now I am able to write simple code in JS. I know rather well HTML and CSS.  Very soon I will be perfect in React. I also know GIT.

###My code examples

```
function func(a,b){
return a + b;
}

func(1,2);
```
